Also, we're going to put three points into one class, which will let us define a triangle. How can we do it?\n","\n","The new class will be called `Triangle` and this is the list of our expectations:\n","- the constructor accepts three arguments - all of them are objects of the `Point` class;\n","- the points are stored inside the object as a private list;\n","- the class provides a parameterless method called `perimeter()`, which calculates the perimeter of the triangle described by the three points; the perimeter is a sum of all legs' lengths (we mention it for the record, although we are sure that you know it perfectly yourself.)\n","\n","Complete the template we've provided in the editor.
